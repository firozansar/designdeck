# Interview

## System design interview

1. Understand the features (goals? users?)
2. Scope (what clients? API? security?)
3. Scale (how many users? how many requests? response time? read/write ratio)
4. Any existing tech stack to leverage?

Final design is less important compared to the thinking process
Also, there's no perfect design, it's important to highlight the tradeoffs of a solution

Treat your interviewer as a teammate and work together

Outline (one component here and there, etc.) then dive in
