# Math

## Associative property

A binary operation is associative if rearranging the parentheses in an expression will not change the result

Example: `+` is associative; e.g., (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4)

## Commutative property

A binary operation is commutative if changing the order of the operands doesn't change the result

Example: `+` is commutative, `/` isn't commutative

## Harmonic mean

x1: probability of p1 (e.g. 0.5)
