# Security

## Authentication

Process of determining whether someone or something is who or what it declares itself to be

## Certificate authorities

Organizations issuing certificates by signing them

## Cipher

Encryption algorithm

## Confidentiality

Process of protecting information from being accessed by unauthorized parties

Mainly achieved via encryption

## Integrity

The process of preserving the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle, so that they cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner

## Mutual TLS

Add client authentication using a certificate

## OAuth 2

Standard for access delegation

Process
- Client gets a token from an authorization server
- Makes a request to a server using the token
- Server validates the token to the authorization server

Notes: some token types like JWT are self-contained, meaning the validation can be done by the server without a call to the authorization server

## Public key infrastructure (PKI)

System for managing, storing, and distributing certificates

Relies on certificate revocation lists (CRLs)

## TLS handshake

With mutual TLS:

1. Client hello: protocol, cipher, etc.
2. Server hello: supported cipher, etc.
3. Server sends its certificate
4. Client checks the server certificate (e.g., make sure the CA are trusted in its truststore, etc.)
5. Client sends its certificate
6. Server checks the client certificate
7. The client generates a session key encrypted with the public key of the client certificate (asymmetric encryption) and sends it to the server
8. Client sends data and encrypts each packet using the session key (symmetric encryption)

One way: the session key is generated by the client

## Two main uses of encryption

Encryption in transit

Encryption at rest

## Two types of encryption

Symmetric: key is shared between a client and a server (faster)

Asymmetric: two keys are used, a private and a public one
- Client encrypts a message with the public key
- Server decrypts the message with its private key

## What does digital signature provide

Integrity and authentication

## What does TLS provide?

- Confidentiality
- Authentication
- Integrity
