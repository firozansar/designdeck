## CDN

Content Delivery Network

Network of geographically dispersed servers used to deliver static content (images, CSS, Javascript files, etc.)

Two kinds of CDNs:
- Push CDN: we are responsible for providing the content
- Pull CDN: CDN is responsible for pulling the right content (expiration to be used)

Pull is easier to handle whereas push gives us more flexibility

Use case for pull: Docker Hub S3 layer
